## Featured Projects  

### [Automatic Language Input Detection](https://github.com/Alasdair-gh/automatic-language-input-detection)  
Real-time classifier for distinguishing **English vs. Pinyin** inputs.  
- Compared Logistic Regression, SVM, CRF, and LSTM models  
- Achieved **F1 score ≈ 0.99** with LSTM on bilingual datasets  
- Built with Python (TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn, CRFsuite)

### [Wage Loss Classification](https://github.com/Alasdair-gh/wage-loss-classification)  
Predicting a ≥10% income drop from employment and demographic survey data.  
- Baseline: Logistic Regression (minority-class F1 ≈ 0.20)  
- Decision Tree (max_depth=4) improved minority-class F1 to ≈ 0.54  
- Key features: starting income, weekly hours, education  
- Includes feature engineering (wage momentum) and one-hot encoding
